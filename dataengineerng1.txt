 For example, let's say we want to keep records with sales greater than 500 and exclude those from the 'West' and 'South' regions:

SELECT order_id, product_id, sales
  FROM orders
 WHERE sales > 500 AND region NOT IN ('West', 'South');









 -- First, find the top three states by total sales
WITH top_states AS (
  SELECT state
  FROM sales_data
  GROUP BY state
  ORDER BY SUM(sales) DESC
  LIMIT 3
),

-- Then, exclude these states and filter sales over $5,000
filtered_sales AS (
  SELECT order_id, city, state, sales
  FROM sales_data
  WHERE state NOT IN (SELECT state FROM top_states)
  AND sales > 5000
)

-- Finally, select the required columns
SELECT order_id, city, state, sales
FROM filtered_sales;

SELECT order_id, city, state, sales
FROM orders
WHERE state NOT IN ('California', 'New York', 'Texas')
AND sales > 5000;
